> this is getting an update with some vital info to know; i am severely autistic (very far down on the autism spectrum). i am seeing a therapist to help me not be so socially awkward and help treat my social anxiety, but this part about me will never ever go away no matter how hard i try. if ppl wanna int i ask you do so first (at least in the first few interactions) because i will end up having a panic attack and shutting off my computer (if you've tried getting close before, you've definitely seen it, and i'm so very sorry about it :( )
